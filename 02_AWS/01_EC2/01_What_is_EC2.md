# What is EC2?

Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a virtual server service in AWS that provides scalable compute power using virtualization technology.
It allows users to create virtual machines with different CPU, RAM and storage configurations to run applications, websites and databases.
EC2 follows a pay-as-you-go model and supports auto scaling and load balancing.
